CI/CD: case Kotlin

I have chosen to review the CI/CD options of the language Kotlin. It is quite popular in Android application development, and it is well known to be the streamlined Java alternative. But Android development isn’t the only thing Kotlin is used for, it is also used for back-end web development as it shares many similarities to Java.
The main IDE for Android development (Android Studio) comes with its own built-in Lint tool. But if one were to develop something other than Android applications, there exists another solution: ktlint, a Kotlin linter. Since Kotlin runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it is compiled into JVM bytecode, which can potentially be decompiled straight to Java. This means Kotlin can utilize some Java frameworks, such as Junit, which is a unit testing framework Java. Junit is a popular candidate for unit testing with Kotlin. Another framework that can be used for testing is also Spring Boot, which another framework known to many Java developers.
The Gradle build system is a very commonly used system with Kotlin projects and not surprisingly, Java projects. Gradle can be run on JVM and it is supported by some of the most commonly used IDEs. Another tool used to control builds is Apache Maven, but it has died down in popularity compared to Gradle.
These tools can be utilized in creating a CI/CD pipeline. One possible option is Gitlab CI. It is a well-supported option that also supports Docker Images. It is a cloud-based solution, but for most projects, a cloud solution is the far superior choice. It requires less maintenance for hardware or software, and most projects aren’t extensive enough to warrant any large investment for the initial setup of a self-hosted pipeline.
